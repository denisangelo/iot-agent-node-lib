# FIWARE IoT Agent Node.js Library

This project aims to provide a Node.js module to enable IoT Agent developers to build custom agents for their devices that can easily connect to NGSI-LD Context Brokers (such as Orion-LD).

An IoT Agent is a component lets groups of devices send their data to and be managed from a FIWARE NGSI-LD Context Broker using their own native protocols. IoT agents should also be able to deal with security aspects of the FIWARE platform (channel authentication and authorization) and provide other common services to the device programmer.

This project is part of FIWARE. For more information, check the FIWARE catalog entry for IoT agents.
